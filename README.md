##  Market Predictability Before the Closing Bell Rings

This study explores the predictability of the last 30 minutes of intraday stock price movements within the US financial market. We analyze various explanatory variables, including intraday returns, overnight returns, federal reserve fund rate decision days, the US dollar index, day-of-week and month effects, and market volatility. Leveraging a Bayesian linear regression model with Student-t error terms, we improve on traditional models to better capture the heavy tails of financial returns. 

Key findings reveal that factors like overnight effects and intraday momentum have weakened over time, while newer patterns, such as "boring day" lunchtime returns and post-Fed decision reactions, have emerged. We also update our findings with data from 2022-2024 to provide fresh insights into the current market landscape.
